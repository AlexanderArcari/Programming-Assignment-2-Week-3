# Programming-Assignment-2-Week-3

The following program outputs the users shipping costs based on their destination, the fragility of the item, and the cost of their item. First, we used IO manipulation to 
format the outputs. Afterwards, we receieve the users input of what item it is, if its fragile, the cost of the order, and the destination. Then, we used nested 
decision structures to determine the shipping costs based on the fragility of the item, the cost of their item, and then the destination that they are shipping to. Then, our
program outputs the user's item in uppercase, the shipping costs associated with the item, the destination, and then the total cost of the order.
